                    <h4>AIM OF THE PROJECT</h4>
                    <p>The aim of our project is to examine and explore the world of children and adolescents malnutrition through the analysis of Open Data. Everything is pursued not only by studying the direct consequences of malnutrition, such as eating disorders and other health diseases but also by analyzing the economic, cultural, and geographical context. The desired result is to get the whole picture that can grasp all the aspects of such a complex and delicate theme.</p>

                    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
                      <p>When one starts approaching the studies concerning eating behavior of children and adolescents, the multifactoriality that determines the "eating experience" must be taken into consideration. In fact, for children, this experience represents not only a mere “way of sustenance” but an opportunity for learning and discovering their own bodies and routines. In young adults, the eating experience becomes an internalized behavior that has a decisive impact on the quality of life.
                        Healthy eating habits are therefore essential for the physical growth and health of the child, but also for psychological and emotional development.
                        The experience is influenced by factors like culture, health status and temperament.
                        A fundamental part in the process of shaping one’s eating behavior is the social component of feeding, which is first acquired through direct experience within the family context.
                        Therefore, it depends on the eating behaviors of family members and on their culture.</p>

                        <p>A direct consequence of unhealthy eating habits acquired in the family context may translate in a multiplicity of facets that a problem related to eating behavior can have:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Overeating.</li>
                                    <li>Poor eating or not gaining sufficient weight.</li>
                                    <li>Feeding behavior problems.</li>
                                    <li>Unusual choices. Pica, or the ingestion of non-food substances</li>
                                    <li>Unhealthy food choices</li>
                                  </ul>
                                   <p>Besides, an optimal diet for children and young adults should include regular eating patterns and a variety of foods, able to guarantee a good mood and good behavior to enhance learning and other fundamental social activities.
                                    Overall, an unhealthy diet seems to depend on several factors such as poverty, urbanization, climate change, and poor food choices.</p>

                                    <p>In our modern society, characterized by technological advancement, the problem is no longer just providing access to food for all children or providing access to an adequate amount of food, but providing access to both quality food and qualitative nutrition education that allows one to maintain a healthy dietary pattern over time.
                                    Adolescents are the ones particularly affected by inappropriate marketing and advertising campaigns, especially young people who live in highly urbanized areas and therefore have easier access to ultra-processed foods, highly sweetened beverages, and fast food. An interesting finding in this research regards the spread of this issue in children and adolescents who live in marginal regions and in conditions of poverty.
                                    The consequence is the global increase of obesity(overweight). The proportion of overweight children between the ages of 5 and 19 has doubled from one in 10 to one in 5 over a period of time from 2000 to 2016.
                                    This trend is also confirmed in high-income countries. E.g., in the United Kingdom, childhood obesity is twice as high in poor areas as in richer areas.
                                    Another factor that has a dramatic impact on the global percentage of malnutrition is the one linked to the climate crisis.
                                    In particular, the areas affected by drought see a dramatic decrease in both quantity and quality of the available food.</p>


                                    <p>In the attempt to provide a solution to the crisis caused by the spread of malnutrition, Unicef is gathering strength in promoting food education policies through cooperation between the public and private sector.
                                    The idea is to rely on schools and parents to monitor children's eating behavior, but also to adopt socio-economic measures that can widely promote healthy nutritional practices in families.
                                    Among the most effective ones, there are sugar taxes, whose aim is to discourage the excessive use of sugar.
                                    Additionally, food suppliers are encouraged to apply sustainable policies to their goods and to deliver them with exhaustive and easily readable labels.
                                    In conclusion, Unicef is fighting to obtain a radical change in how children and teenagers’ diet is perceived,
                                    aware of the seriousness and importance of this sensible yet underestimated topic.</p>

                                    <h4>MEDICAL ASPECTS</h4>
                                    <p>To deepen the medical and sanitary aspect of the general malnutrition problem, we put our efforts in our project in showing the diseases that are a direct consequence of wrong nutritional choices/patterns.
                                    Scientific evidence proves that Children that follow unhealthy eating behaviors, can develop serious chronic diseases.
                                    The analysis of the link between these diseases and bad nutrition was carried out to highlight the seriousness of the problem and to raise awareness about it.
                                    Here the listing of the recurrent health issues related to malnutrition, based on scientific researches:</p>
